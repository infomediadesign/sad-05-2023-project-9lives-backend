Rules of using GitHub:

1. We have 2 different repositories for Frontend and Backend.
2. Name your branch as "feature/feature_name/Firstnameinitial_and_lastnameinitial"
3. Commit and push only in your feature branch.
4. The code will be merged in Dev and after resolving all the conflicts then it will be merged with the main branch.

**NOTE**: Please refer *main* branch for the code, *dev* branch is the merger branch, working branches have been either deleted or marked inactive
